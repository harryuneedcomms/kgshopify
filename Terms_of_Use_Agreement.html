    <h1>Terms of Use Agreement</h1>

    <p>
      These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and conditions 
      of your use of the <strong>One-Second Signup</strong> service (“Website” or “Service”) 
      and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement 
      is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Service operator 
      (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). By accessing and using the Website and Services, 
      you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of 
      this Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a business or 
      other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to 
      this Agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such 
      entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of 
      this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may not access and use the 
      Website and Services. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you 
      and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you, 
      and it governs your use of the Website and Services.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Accounts and membership</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Website and Services. By using the 
      Website and Services and by agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent that 
      you are at least 13 years of age. If you create an account on the Website, you are 
      responsible for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible 
      for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection 
      with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you 
      may sign in and start using the Services. Providing false contact information of any kind 
      may result in the termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of any 
      unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. We will not be 
      liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as 
      a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account 
      (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this 
      Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. 
      If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our 
      Services. We may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent 
      further registration.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
    <p>
      The Free and Professional plans will generate attribution link(s) on the homepage footer. 
      The attribution link(s) must not be removed or hidden. If you require the attribution 
      link(s) to be excluded, then you can subscribe to the Premium Plan, which does not 
      include any attribution link(s).
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      Although the Website and Services may link to other resources (such as websites, 
      mobile applications, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval, 
      association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless 
      specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and 
      we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of 
      their resources. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, 
      products, services, and content of any other third parties. You should carefully review 
      the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which you access 
      through a link on the Website and Services. Your linking to any other off-site resources 
      is at your own risk.

      to perform or participate in any unlawful acts; (c) to violate any international, federal, 
      provincial or state regulations, rules, laws, or local ordinances; (d) to infringe upon

      or any other type of malicious code that will or may be used in any way that will affect 
      the functionality or operation of the Website and Services, third party products and 
      services, or the Internet; (h) to spam, phish, pharm, pretext, spider, crawl, or scrape; 
      (i) for any obscene or immoral purpose; or (j) to interfere with or circumvent the security

      We reserve the right to terminate your use of the Website and Services for violating any 
      of the prohibited uses.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the Operator, its 
      affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable 
      to any person for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential 
      damages (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, revenue, sales, goodwill, 
      use of content, impact on business, business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, 
      loss of business opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including, 
      without limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence or 
      otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to the possibility of such damages 
      or could have foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, 
      the aggregate liability of the Operator and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, 
      suppliers and licensors relating to the services will be limited to an amount greater 
      of one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you to the Operator for the prior 
      one month period prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. 
      The limitations and exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you 
      for any losses or fails of its essential purpose.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify and hold the Operator and its affiliates, directors, officers, 
      employees, agents, suppliers and licensors harmless from and against any liabilities, 
      losses, damages or costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection 
      with or arising from any third party allegations, claims, actions, disputes, or demands 
      asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your Content, your use of 
      the Website and Services or any willful misconduct on your part.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Severability</h2>
    <p>
      All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be 
      applicable and binding only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws 
      and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render 
      this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any 
      provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by 
      a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining 
      provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the 
      subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall 
      remain in full force and effect.
    </p>
